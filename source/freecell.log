To Do:

    The code gets confused moving piles sometimes. For example,
    it will move J Q onto J Q K 

Jan 2:
    Renamed 'drawpileCard' to 'drawPileCard'

Dec 26, 2001:
    Fixed case problems - new version of wxBasic is case sensitive
    about constants.


Nov 2, 2001:
    Added hints

Oct 31, 2001: 0.41 release
    Fixed bug in autoMovePile,
                    goal[k,1] = pile[i,j,1]
                    goal[k,1] = pile[i,j,1]

            should have been:
                    goal[k,1] = pile[i,j,1]
                    goal[k,2] = pile[i,j,2]

    Fixed: Max cards in stack is now 52, so will not overflow

    Changed: Prompt message was "Move Pile?", is now "Move Stack?"

    Changed: First tries to move stack, then moves individual card

    Fixed: Better handling of stacks

    Fixed: Moves stacks to empty columns

    Fixed: Moves entire stacks

Oct 31, 2001: 0.40 release

    Fixed: No longer moves FreeCell onto King in holding cell.

    Added: Cheat Mode. Allows for easier testing.

    Fixed: Double click now acts differently than single click.

    Fixed: Automove only happens when a card is no longer needed.
           ie: There is no lower card of opposite suit on the board.

    Added: Right click exposes card under mouse.

    Added: Automatic moving of piles
